## Introduction

We released today our [tutorial](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/tree/GeoLiftPython) explaining how to run an end-to-end implementation of GeoLift in Python leveraging the `rpy2` package.  This has been a feature frequently requested in the past by stakeholders. And one that we believe is very important for the continued scaling of GeoLift in data-savvy organizations.

The goal of this tutorial is to empower Python users to run the GeoLift R functions in Python using the [`rpy2`](https://rpy2.github.io) package. The rpy2 is an open source library which enables calling R from Python. Itâ€™s designed to facilitate the use of R by Python programmers.


## GeoLift in Python

GeoLift is an end-to-end solution to measure Lift at a Geo-level using the latest developments in Synthetic Control Methods. Through this tutorial it is possible to run GeoLift R functions as power calculations, inference, and plots in Python:

There are 3 functions in Python under utils.py:

- `GeoLiftData`: Load and return the dataset included in the GeoLift package.

- `ConvertDf`: Convert R dataframe into Pandas if `conv_type = "ToPandas"` or convert Pandas dataframe into R if `conv_type = "ToR"`.

- `GeoLiftPlot`: Receive a specific GeoLift Plot function (defined by the `func` parameter), its arguments and display the plot.

We've introduced a set of new capabilities to GeoLift focused at Multi-Cell tests. Specifically, we added four new functions to set-up and execute these tests in a simple yet powerful way.

### 1. MultiCellMarketSelection
`MultiCellMarketSelection()` will help the user identify and select their Test Markets based on their desired number of cells for either Standard or Inverse/Negative GeoLifts.

### 2. MultiCellPower
After finding the optimal test and control locations for the Multi-Cell test, the user is able to estimate and plot the Power Curves for each of his Test Markets through the `MultiCellPower()` function.

### 3. MultiCellWinner
When the test's objective is to identify a winner strategy or channel, the user has the option to use `MultiCellWinner()` which will identify how much better the performance of Cell A compared to Cell B should be in order to declare a winner through a statistical test. If more than two cells are provided, the test will perform all pairwise comparisons.

### 4. GeoLiftMultiCell
Finally, after the test finishes `GeoLiftMultiCell()` will compute the inference and will show whether there was a winning cell based on the test results!
