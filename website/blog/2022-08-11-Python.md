## Introduction

Today we released a [tutorial](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/tree/GeoLiftPython) explaining how to run an end-to-end implementation of GeoLift in Python leveraging the `rpy2` package.  This has been a frequently requested feature by the GeoLift community. Moreover, it is one that we believe is very important for the continued scaling of GeoLift in data-savvy organizations.

The goal of this tutorial is to empower Python users to run the GeoLift R functions in Python using the [`rpy2`](https://rpy2.github.io) package. The rpy2 is an open source library which enables calling R from Python. It’s designed to facilitate the use of R by Python programmers.


## GeoLift in Python

GeoLift is an end-to-end solution to measure Lift at a Geo-level using the latest developments in Synthetic Control Methods. Through this tutorial it is possible to run GeoLift R functions such as: Power Calculations, Inference, and Plots in Python.

There are 3 functions in Python under utils.py:

- `GeoLiftData`: Load and return the dataset included in the GeoLift package.

- `ConvertDf`: Convert R dataframe into Pandas if `conv_type = "ToPandas"` or convert Pandas dataframe into R if `conv_type = "ToR"`.

- `GeoLiftPlot`: Receive a specific GeoLift Plot function (defined by the `func` parameter), its arguments and display the plot.

To run the R GeoLift functions in Python, you need to add `GeoLift.` in front of it as in `GeoLift.GeoLiftMarketSelection()`. For example:

## Start Your GeoLift in Python Now!​

You can access the GeoLift in Python tutorial in the GeoLiftPython folder hosted in the GeoLift github repository through [this link](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/tree/GeoLiftPython). The `README` file contains all the necessary information to start working with the Python version of GeoLift.
