## GeoLift v2.3 Release

### TL;DR
- The new version of the GeoLift code makes the pre-test analysis (Power Analysis and Market Selection) easier than ever before! The entire process is now handled by a single function: `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`.
- The new package contains dozens of new features, functionalities, and bug fixes.
- A new and improved walkthrough guide is available to help internal and external users run their GeoLift tests from start to finish!

## GeoLift v2.3: Power Calculations Made Easier
Following the feedback we received, we re-built the Power Calculation and Market Selection functionalities from the ground up! The new code makes this process easier, more streamlined, and more powerful than ever before.

### What's New?
- We've **streamlined the entire Power Analysis and Market Selection process into a single function**: `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`.
- Previously, the process to select the test markets was very convoluted and involved going through several functions: `NumberLocations()`, `GeoLiftPower.search()`, `GeoLiftPowerFinder()`, and `GeoLiftPower()`. The new function, `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`, aggregates all of their functionalities and even improves upon them.
- We're soft-deprecating the `NumberLocations()`, `GeoLiftPower.search()`, `GeoLiftPowerFinder()`, and `GeoLiftPower()`. The development of these functions is now considered complete and they're now superseeded by `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`.
- We've included **two** new important **metrics** that can help us make better decisions when comparing between different test market candidates: _Average_MDE_ and _abs_lift_in_zero_.
- A **new and improved ranking system** takes into consideration all key model performance metrics to identify the best test markets for a given set-up.
- We've added the option for **one tailed tests**.  These make the GeoLift model much more powerful than it was before, by simply changing the test hypothesis we want to validate.  Now you can chose from _Positive_, _Negative_ and _Total_ tests in the inference section and one sided or two sided tests in the power section.
- The Market Selection process is more flexible and customizable than before! You can now include **additional test constraints** to focus only on the tests that make sense for our client. These are: the available budget (_budget_), acceptable holdout ranges (_holdout_), test markets we want to force into the test regions (_include_markets_), and markets that shouldn't be considered as eligible test regions (_exclude_markets_).
- We've added a **new plotting method for GeoLiftMarketSelection** objects. Through this method you can easily plot different test market selections and compare their model fit, MDE, and power curves! Plus, they lines have the GeoLift colors!

- The **new function**: `GetWeights()` makes it easy to save the synthetic control weights into a data frame for further analysis.
- To aid with **MMM calibrations**, we've included a new parameter in the Market Selection/Power Analysis function: _Correlations_. Setting it to TRUE allows the user to analyze the similarities between test and the control regions.
- You can also **plot historical similarities between test and control regions** with `plotCorrels()`.

- A revamped **GeoLift walkthrough vignette has been launched** to accompany the new version of the package. This new material provides much more detailed explanation on our model, it's parameters, how to run a study, and how to interpret the results.
- We've **fixed multiple bug and errors** across the package (thanks for the feedback!).
- Thanks to all of these changes, we've **significantly reduced the total time needed in pre-test calculations!**
