GeoLift v2.3.4 (Release date: 2022-03-14)
=========================================

Changes:

* Simplified GeoLiftPowerFinder, GeoLiftPower.search, GeoLiftPower & GeoLiftMarketSelection, unifying the simulation operations under the same method: run_simulations.

GeoLift v2.3.3 (Release date: 2022-03-14)
=========================================

Changes:

* Adapted GeoLiftPower to use `lookback_window` hyperparameter replacing `horizon`, which is much less confusing.

GeoLift v2.3.2 (Release date: 2022-03-14)
=========================================

Changes:

* Enabled GeoLiftMarketSelection to go through positive and negative effects, at the same time.

GeoLift v2.3.1 (Release date: 2022-03-14)
=========================================

Changes:

* Simplified code for plot.GeoLiftPower.
* Added hyperparameter to show MDE values.
* Added optional smoothed curve for power.

GeoLift v2.3.0 (Release date: 2022-02-24)
=========================================

Changes:

* Simplified Power Analysis through a single function: GeoLiftMarketSelection().
* To aid in MMM calibrations we included the ability to calculate correlations between test markets and the aggregate of all locations.
* Added investment to the GeoLiftPower output object.
* Revamped the GeoLiftPowerPlot and added legends to the plot.
* Updated the NumberLocations() plot.
* Fixed issues with GeoLift() caused when the input of the locations parameter had special characters.
* Fixed issue with the range of the x axis of GeoPlot() to avoid receiving the warning message: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_vline).
* NumberLocations(), GeoLiftPowerFinder(), and GeoLiftPower.search() are now superseeded by GeoLiftMarketSelection(). We recommend the latter for all power analyses.
* New function GetWeights() returns a dataframe with the weights of the synthetic control model for a given test set-up.
* Added a new plotting function: plotCorrels() to analyze similarities between test and control regions.

GeoLift v2.2.2 (Release date: 2021-02-04)
=========================================

Changes:

* Changed pkg structure.

GeoLift v2.2.1 (Release date: 2021-12-30)
=========================================

Changes:

* Limiting potential test markets to half the amount of available test markets.

GeoLift v2.2.0 (Release date: 2021-12-15)
=========================================

Changes:

* Included lift detected in zero into ranking function for GeoLiftPowerFinder.

GeoLift v2.1.10 (Release date: 2021-12-03)
=========================================

Changes:

* Updated documentation files to match new repository
* Changed devtools for remotes as recommended install method

GeoLift v2.1.9 (Release date: 2021-11-17)
=========================================

Changes:

* Row names from weight matrix were location names. Now they are another column within the matrix.

GeoLift v2.1.8 (Release date: 2021-11-05)
=========================================

Changes:

* Fixed budget filter for inverse/negative Lift in GeoLiftMarketSelection().
* Changed the logic of small pre-treatment warnings in all power calcs. We now recommend having 4x pre-treatment to treatment periods.
* Added the keep_unix_time parameter to GeoDataRead() to keep dates in the data.frame.

GeoLift v2.1.7 (Release date: 2021-10-29)
=========================================

Changes:

* Created the cumulative effect plot in line with our branding guidelines.

GeoLift v2.1.6 (Release date: 2021-10-29)
=========================================

Changes:

* Enhanced the Lift Plot to agree with our branding guidelines.


GeoLift v2.1.5 (Release date: 2021-10-29)
=========================================

Changes:

* Enhanced the ATT Plot to be in agreeable with our branding guidelines.  Added incrementality plot as well.

GeoLift v2.1.4 (Release date: 2021-10-22)
=========================================

Changes:

* Adding the GeoLiftMarketSelection() function which provides an option to perform all power calculations in a single step.

GeoLift v2.1.3 (Release date: 2021-10-18)
=========================================

Changes:

* Allows to run one sided and two sided tests in power calculations, by specifying the parameter `side_of_test` in GeoLiftPower, GeoLiftPowerFinder.

GeoLift v2.1.2 (Release date: 2021-10-03)
=========================================

Changes:

* Makes parallelization errors more verbose, by using the `.errorhandling='stop'` option instead of `.errorhandling='remove'` within the `foreach` method.

GeoLift v2.1.1 (Release date: 2021-10-01)
=========================================

Changes:

* Allows to import packages that are not installed on all nodes being used by parallelization, using the `import_augsynth_from` method.
